    "Anomaly detection is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to identify data points or patterns that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior within a dataset. These deviant data points are known as anomalies or outliers. The purpose of anomaly detection is to highlight unusual and potentially interesting instances that do not conform to the majority of the data.\n",

    "Anomaly detection comes with several challenges that can affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the process:\n",

    "- Lack of labeled data: In many real-world scenarios, it is difficult or expensive to obtain labeled anomalies for training supervised models, making unsupervised techniques more practical.\n",

    "- Imbalanced data: Anomalies are often rare, leading to imbalanced datasets where normal instances heavily outnumber anomalous ones. This can affect the model's ability to detect anomalies accurately.\n",

    "- Novelty detection: Some anomalies might be entirely new or previously unseen, making it challenging for the model to recognize them as anomalies.\n",

    "- High-dimensional data: As the dimensionality of data increases, traditional distance metrics might become less effective, and the curse of dimensionality can impact the performance of some algorithms.\n",

    "- Noise and variability: In real-world datasets, there can be noise or irrelevant variations that make it harder to distinguish anomalies from normal instances.\n",
